//SALESFORCE PLATFORM BASICS

1. Salesforce Kya Hai? (CRM vs. Platform)
Log sochte hain Salesforce sirf ek CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software hai jo data store karta hai.

Reality: Salesforce ek Platform hai.

Analogy (Jo text mein di gayi hai):

CRM (Standard Features): Yeh ek "Model House" jaisa hai jo bana-banaya milta hai (features like Sales, Service, Marketing).

Platform: Yeh wo suvidha hai jisse aap us ghar ko renovate karke apna "Unique Home" bana sakte hain (Custom apps aur features banana).

2. Dreamhouse Scenario (Real World Example)
Trailhead mein Dreamhouse Realty naam ki ek fictional company use ki gayi hai concepts samjhane ke liye.

Problem: Dreamhouse real estate (ghar bechne) ka business karti hai. Unhe standard "Sales" process ke alawa kuch specific cheezein chahiye (jaise Properties manage karna).

Solution: Unka Admin (D'Angelo) Salesforce Platform ka use karke Custom Objects aur apps banata hai taaki Brokers (Michelle) properties ko filter aur sell kar sakein.

3. Key Terminology (Bahut Important)
Salesforce ka data structure samajhne ke liye in 5 terms ko yaad rakhein. Sochiye ki Salesforce ek Excel Spreadsheet hai:

Term	Definition	Spreadsheet Analogy	Example
App	Tools aur Objects ka ek group jo kisi specific kaam ke liye hota hai.	Workbook (Collection of sheets)	Dreamhouse App
Object	Data store karne ke liye ek table.	Tab/Sheet	Property, Contact, Account
Record	Object ke andar ek specific entry (data).	Row (Horizontal line)	"House at 123 Main St"
Field	Object ke andar data ki category/attribute.	Column (Vertical line)	Price, Address, Phone Number
Org	Aapka specific Salesforce instance (Login environment).	Entire Excel File	Aapka Trailhead Playground

Export to Sheets

Standard Objects: Jo Salesforce pehle se deta hai (e.g., Account, Contact, Lead).

Custom Objects: Jo aap apni business need ke hisaab se banate hain (e.g., Property).

4. Development: No-Code vs. Programmatic
Salesforce mein develop karne ke do tarike hain:

No-Code (Declarative): Mouse click aur drag-and-drop se (Jo D'Angelo kar raha hai). Yeh Admin ka kaam hai.

Programmatic: Code likh kar (Apex, LWC). Yeh Developer ka kaam hai (Jo aap future mein seekhenge).

5. Is Unit Mein Aapko Kya Karna Hai? (Practical Steps)
Is module ko complete karne ke liye aapko hands-on practice karni hogi:

Create Trailhead Playground: Yeh ek practice environment hai (Developer Edition) jahan aap galti kar sakte hain bina real data kharab kiye.

Install Dreamhouse App: Package ID (04tKY000000LOv6YAG) use karke Dreamhouse app install karna hai taaki aapke paas sample data aa jaye.

Create a Custom Field (Tutorial): Text mein unhone dikhaya ki "Contact" object par "Prequalified?" naam ka Checkbox field kaise banayein.

⚠️ Challenge Solution Hint (Exam ke liye)
Text ke end mein likha hai: "Now, test out what you learned by making a completely new field... make a currency field."

Tutorial mein unhone Checkbox sikhaya, lekin points lene ke liye aapko Currency Field banana hai.

Steps to solve the Challenge:

Setup mein jayein -> Object Manager -> Contact select karein.

Fields & Relationships -> New pe click karein.

Data Type select karein: Currency (Checkbox mat choose karna!).

Label dalein: Loan Amount (ya jo challenge mein specific naam diya ho, usually yeh "Loan Amount" hota hai).

Save karein.


//instll externa app or package
Here are the short steps to install the Dreamhouse App:

Open Starter: Launch Playground -> Click App Launcher (9 dots) -> Select Playground Starter.

Paste ID: Click Install a Package tab -> Paste ID: 04tKY000000LOv6YAG -> Click Install.

Install: Select Install for All Users -> Click Install -> Approve Access -> Done.

Import Data: Go to App Launcher -> Select Dreamhouse -> Click Settings tab -> Click Import Data.


1. Proper Definition of Salesforce Platform
Definition: The Salesforce Platform (technically known as Platform as a Service or PaaS) is a set of underlying services and tools that allows businesses to build, run, and manage custom applications on top of Salesforce's existing infrastructure.

Instead of just using the software as it comes (SaaS), the Platform gives you the tools to customize the software to fit your specific business needs without worrying about servers, security, or database maintenance.

2. How/Why is it a "Platform"?
Salesforce is considered a platform because it provides the building blocks to create something new, rather than just providing a finished product. Here is the breakdown:

A. Customization (Build Unique Solutions)

Concept: Standard Salesforce gives you "Sales" and "Service" apps. The Platform lets you build apps for anything else (e.g., a "Real Estate" app for Dreamhouse).

Example: As seen in the text, D'Angelo (the Admin) didn't just use standard Contact fields; he used the platform tools to create a Custom Object called "Property" and a Custom Field called "Prequalified?". This ability to change the structure makes it a platform.

B. Development Capabilities (No-Code & Pro-Code)

Declarative (No-Code): You can build apps using drag-and-drop tools (like Flow Builder or Object Manager) without writing code.

Programmatic (Pro-Code): If you are a developer, the platform lets you write code (Apex, JavaScript/LWC) to create highly complex functions.

Why this matters: A simple software is "use as is." A platform is "build what you need."

C. The "Model House" Analogy The text uses a perfect analogy to explain this:

CRM (The Application): It is like buying a Model House. It has walls, a roof, and furniture. You can live in it immediately, but it looks exactly like your neighbor's house.

The Platform: It is like having the tools to Renovate. You can knock down a wall, add a new room (Custom Object), or hang your own art (Branding). It transforms the standard house into your home.

D. Infrastructure Handling

When you build on the Salesforce Platform, you don't need to install a database or configure a server.

The platform automatically handles the Database, Security, User Interface (UI), and Mobile compatibility. You just focus on the business logic.

//submodule 2
Akshat, yeh unit ("Discover Use Cases for the Platform") aapke **Salesforce Trainee interview** ke liye bahut crucial hai. Interviewer aapse zaroor puchega: *"Salesforce ko hum Sales team ke alawa aur kahan use kar sakte hain?"*

Is unit ka main concept hai: **Salesforce sirf Sales ke liye nahi hai, yeh poori company ka Operating System ban sakta hai.**

Niche maine is unit ko simple points mein break down kiya hai:

---

### 1. "High Impact, Low Effort" Strategy
Jab aap Salesforce naya seekh rahe hain, toh aapko aise problems dhundne chahiye jo **bade (High Impact)** hon lekin solve karne mein **aasaan (Low Effort)** hon.

**Kaise pehchanein ki kise Automate karna hai?**
Agar kisi department mein yeh problems hain, toh wo Salesforce ke liye perfect candidate hai:
* Bahut zyada **Emails** bheje ja rahe hain collaboration ke liye.
* Log **Excel Spreadsheets** par dependent hain.
* Documents local computer folders mein save ho rahe hain (Shared nahi hain).
* Kaam **Manual aur Repetitive** hai (baar-baar wahi karna padta hai).

---

### 2. Dreamhouse Real World Scenarios (Department-wise)

Is unit mein bataya gaya hai ki D'Angelo (Admin) ne kaise alag-alag departments ki help ki:

#### A. Sales Department (Flows & AI)
* **Problem:** Brokers alag-alag tarike se property data enter kar rahe the. Data missing tha aur format galat tha.
* **Solution:**
    * **Flow Builder:** D'Angelo ne ek "Screen Flow" banaya. Yeh ek wizard/form ki tarah hota hai jo user se step-by-step sahi data mangta hai. Isse data clean aur standard ho gaya.
    * **Prompt Builder (AI):** Yeh naya feature hai. D'Angelo ne AI use kiya taaki jab koi property add ho, toh system automatically customer ke liye ek **Personalized Email** likh de.

#### B. HR Department (Recruiting App)
* **Problem:** Julian (HR) ke paas hundreds of resumes aa rahe the aur wo manage nahi kar pa raha tha.
* **Solution:** D'Angelo ne ek **Custom App** banaya jisme:
    * Job Openings ki list hai.
    * Candidates ka data store hota hai.
    * Interview reminders automatic jaate hain.
* **Benefit:** Ab HR team **Salesforce Mobile App** se bhi hiring kar sakti hai.

#### C. IT Department (Ticketing System)
* **Problem:** Regina (IT) ke paas emails par IT requests aa rahi thi aur track karna mushkil tha.
* **Solution:** Salesforce ke andar hi **IT Ticketing System** bana diya.
* **Benefit:**
    * Employees wahi login karte hain jahan CRM hai.
    * Reports se pata chalta hai ki kitne tickets pending hain.
    * Hardware (Laptops/Mobiles) ka inventory bhi manage hota hai.

---

### 3. Other Departments (Interview Cheat Sheet)
Agar interview mein pucha jaye ki "Finance ya Supply chain mein Salesforce kaise use hoga?", toh yeh examples yaad rakhein:

| Department | Use Case (Salesforce mein kya ban sakta hai) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Finance** | Budget Management, Contract Management, Pricing control. |
| **Product** | Warranty Management, New Product Ideas track karna. |
| **Supply Chain** | Vendor (Supplier) Management, Procurement (Samaan kharidna). |
| **Ops** | Asset Management (Office furniture/machines manage karna). |

---

### 4. Quiz Solutions (Logic ke saath)

Aapne jo quiz questions share kiye hain, unke answers ye honge:

**Q1: When identifying processes to bring into Salesforce, what are some things to look for?**
* **Logic:** Hum wo kaam dhundte hain jo manual ho aur spreadsheets pe ho.
* **Correct Answer:** Looks for: Heavy email collaboration, Reliance on spreadsheets, Time-intensive manual steps.

**Q2: What are three use cases for Finance on the Salesforce platform?**
* **Logic:** Upar table mein dekhein Finance section.
* **Correct Answer:** **Budget management, Contract management, Pricing.**

Setup: Your New Work Home
Earlier, we mentioned that you’ll spend a lot of time in Setup during your time as a Salesforce administrator. And we weren’t kidding. Setup is your one-stop-shop for customizing, configuring, and supporting your org.

Since there’s so much you can do in the Setup area, it’s important to get comfortable with navigating it. There are a few ways to approach it. As you learn what’s available to you, you’ll get more comfortable finding the things you need.

You can get to Setup from any page in your Salesforce org. From the gear menu at the top of the screen ( Setup.), click Setup.

Let’s get familiar with the Setup area.

The standard view of Setup's homepage.

Object Manager: Object Manager is where you can view and customize standard and custom objects in your org.
Setup Menu: The menu gives you quick links to a collection of pages that let you do everything from managing your users to modifying security settings.
Main Window: We’re showing you the Setup home page, but this is where you can see whatever it is you’re trying to work on.
The Setup Menu is the trickiest piece to navigate because there are so many different pages you can access. There are two ways to get where you want to go. If you already have an idea where to look, expand the appropriate menu and select the page you want. If you aren’t sure where to look, use the Quick Find box to search. Let’s say you wanted to manage your user permission sets. If you happen to know that permission sets are in the Users menu under Administration, just open that menu and click Permission Sets. Otherwise type permission setsCopy in the Quick Find box.

Get Cozy with the Setup Menu
There are three main categories in the Setup menu: Administration, Platform Tools, and Settings. Let’s take a look at what’s available.

Administration: The Administration category is where you manage your users and data. You can do things like add users, change permissions, import and export data, and create email templates.
Platform Tools: You do most of your customization in Platform Tools. You can view and manage your data model, create apps, modify the user interface, and deploy new features to your users. If you decide to try your hand at programmatic development, Platform Tools is where you manage your code as well.
Settings: Finally, Settings is where you manage your company information and org security. You can do things like add business hours, change your locale, and view your org’s history.
Of course, these are only some of the pages you can access in the Setup menu. To get you started on the right foot, here’s a list of our top five Setup pages to know about.

//APP EXCHANGE
Power Up with AppExchange
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

Develop your own AppExchange strategy.
Install an app from AppExchange.
What Is AppExchange?
You’re probably comfortable with the idea of app stores. Whether you’re downloading apps on your phone, tablet, computer, or other device, you have to download and install apps to make the most of your technology.

Salesforce is the same way. Salesforce has a community of partners in its enterprise ecosystem that use the flexibility of the Salesforce platform to build amazing apps and other solutions that anyone can use. These offerings are available (some for free, some at a cost) for installation on AppExchange.

The AppExchange homepage.

Strategies for Success
D’Angelo’s Dreamhouse app is a raging success among the company real estate brokers. But if we’re being realistic, D’Angelo is only one person. There are only so many hours in the day for him to develop new apps for his colleagues.

Luckily, AppExchange is full of apps D’Angelo can download to help Dreamhouse manage everything from payroll to travel approval to integrations with other tools like Evernote and MailChimp.

The possibilities AppExchange offers are exciting, but before you start downloading every app in sight, you need to develop a strategy. A solid AppExchange strategy helps ensure that you’re getting the highest value apps without duplicating functionality or investing in something that you don’t need.

Follow these steps to develop a good AppExchange strategy.

Identify departments that use or plan to use Salesforce. These are your primary stakeholders.
Research what’s available on AppExchange that best meets your stakeholder requirements. Discuss business cases with department heads to determine exact needs. Here are some good questions to ask:
What business problem are you trying to solve?
What are your main pain points right now?
How many users need this app?
What’s your budget?
What’s your timeline?
These questions help you identify apps that are the best fit for each department or business case.

When you find an app that you think meets your needs, download the app in a test environment (like a free Developer Edition or sandbox). Ensure that the app you’re installing doesn’t interfere with any other apps you’ve installed or customizations you’ve made. Sandboxes are copies of your organization in a separate environment. They’re used for development and testing. See the Sandbox Types and Templates documentation.
If you’re choosing between multiple apps, take some time to evaluate what you’ve tested. Determine whether there are feature gaps or unwanted functionality. If necessary, invite your stakeholders to demo the apps and provide feedback.
You’re ready to go! You’ll install and deploy your app in your production environment. Make sure you keep your users in the loop about what’s changing, and provide training and documentation as necessary.
Install Your First App
While AppExchange resembles a traditional app store like you can find on your phone or tablet, it’s important to remember that your Salesforce org is a complicated environment. You can’t just install an app because it has a cool logo or a convincing catchphrase.

So what’s the right way to install an app? We’ll show you! This is just an example–no need to follow along.

Let’s say you find this great app on AppExchange that lets you send SMS messages within Marketing Cloud Engagement automations.

The AppExchange Marketing Cloud Account Engagement and Digital SMS Integration page.

To install the app, you would click Get It Now. This button takes you to the installation wizard that guides you through the steps. But first, here are three key questions you need to answer before you install the app:

Are there any notes or requirements included on the app listing that I need to consider before installing this app? For example, this SMS app contains a note that says Note - you MUST own Digital Engagement, and have Messaging enabled before you can install this package. So, make sure you’ve met all requirements before you install the app.
Where do I install the app, production or sandbox? In general, it’s a best practice to first install apps in a nonproduction environment. Try installing in a sandbox for your production org or in a Developer Edition org. Testing the app first helps you avoid conflicts in production with things like object names.
Should I give app permissions to admins only, all users, or specific profiles? That depends on who the app is for. If you want to limit access to a particular set of users, plan to modify those user profiles before you install the app.
Where’d My App Go?
Awesome. So that's how you would install an app. Now, if only you could find it... Here is how you find apps after you've installed them.

Apps are installed using something called a package (remember when you installed the Dreamhouse app?). To find the package:

From Setup, search and select Installed Packages in the Quick Find box.
Click the name of the package you installed. It will be the same name from the AppExchange download page.
Click View Components to see more information about the package. The Package Details page shows you all the components, including custom fields, custom objects, and Apex classes in the package. This information helps you determine whether you have any conflicts in your own customizations.
Some Final Thoughts
As you start to explore AppExchange, be sure to check out free apps provided by Salesforce Labs. The great thing about Salesforce Labs apps, other than that they’re free, is that they’re open source. You can customize them as needed and peek under the hood to see how they work. It’s a great way to learn more about how the platform works.

Speaking of learning more, this module has given you a great foundation for diving deeper into the Salesforce platform. Check out the resources below for some potential next steps in your journey. Happy trails!
